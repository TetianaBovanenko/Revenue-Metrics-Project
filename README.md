In this project I created a dashboard for analyzing cash flows, empowering product managers to track changes in cash inflows and conduct detailed analysis of influencing factors.

The dashboard includes several key metrics:

 1) Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR): Revenue for a calendar month from repeating sources.
 2) Paid Users: The number of users who are paying.
 3) Average Revenue Per Paid User (ARPPU): Calculated as Revenue / Paid Users.
 4) New Paid Users: Users who initiated payments in the corresponding period.
 5) New MRR: MRR generated by paid users in the relevant month.
 6) Churned Users: Users who ceased payments in the corresponding period.
 7) Churn Rate: The ratio of Churned Users to Paid Users in the previous period.
 8) Churned Revenue: Total revenue from users who stopped paying in the previous period.
 9) Revenue Churn Rate: The ratio of revenue from users who didn't continue paying in the previous month to revenue for a specific calendar month.
 10) Expansion MRR: Increase in MRR from one month to another by users paying more.
 11) Contraction MRR: Decrease in MRR from one month to the next by users paying less.
 12) Customer Lifetime (LT): Average time from first payment to user churn.
 13) Customer Lifetime Value (LTV): Average total amount paid by one user over their product usage.

The dashboard comprises seven charts with filters by date, user language, and age. Two charts specifically highlight factors influencing monthly revenue and paid users.

During a visual presentation, I presented the project from the user's perspective, demonstrating how to effectively utilize the dashboard for informed decision-making.
